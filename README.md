# Description of the project
The project shows randomized planets with all different terrain and designs, all procedurally generated.

The picture painted in code is about an astronaut wandering space and seeing beautiful planets in the void.

The planets are to orbit around each other in a 3D environment and spin.

# Proposal:
For my Games Engines project, I would like to build a universe that uses procedurally generated art for the planet textures.

The user will be able to:
* reset/create a new universe with a button.
* change how the universe would look and move by changing the list of variables using scrollbars.
* move through the universe as an astronaut.
* float through the universe by letting go of their controls.
