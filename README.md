# GamesEngines

For my Games Engines 1 project, I would like to build a universe that uses procedurally generated art for the planet textures.

The user will be able to:
*reset/create a new universe with a button.
*change how the universe would look like by changing the list of variables using scrollbars.
*move through the universe.
*float through the universe by letting go of their controls.
