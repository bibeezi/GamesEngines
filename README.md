# Procedurally Generated Art on Planets

**Name:** Bianca Claudette Palileo

**Student Number:** C18326906

**Class Group:** DT228/4 or TU856/4


# Description of the project
The project shows randomized planets with all different terrain and designs, all procedurally generated.

The picture painted in code is about an astronaut wandering space and seeing beautiful planets in the void.

The universe is contained in a galaxy sphere with stars and contains nebulas.

<!-- The planets are to orbit around each other in a 3D environment and spin. -->

# Instructions for use
The player can simply let the astronaut guide themselves around the universe.
Otherwise, the player can press space and control the astronaut slowly around with W, A, S, D keys and look around with the mouse.

*The movement is quite slow because it is hard to move in space and the astronaut uses velocity to move through space*

# What I am most proud of in the assignment:
I am most proud of generating the nebulas' and planets' shapes and colours randomly and spawning them in random points in the galaxy range using scripts to do so, rather than changing values in the editors themselves.

I am also proud of this project because it is my first Unity project.

Lastly, I am proud of being able to incorporate code from references and link them to my own work (where I learned and used, inheritance, Unity classes, coroutines, spawners, character controls and physics, particle systems, procedural generation and simplex noise!) to make a cool visual project.


# Proposal:
<!-- For my Games Engines project, I would like to build a universe that uses procedurally generated art for the planet textures. -->
For my Games Engines project, I would like to build a universe that use procedurally generated terrain, colour and textures for the planet.

The user will be able to:
<!-- * reset/create a new universe with a button. -->
<!-- * change how the universe would look and move by changing the list of variables using scrollbars. -->
* move through the universe as an astronaut and look around to see the nebulas, stars and planets.
* float through the universe by toggling controls.
